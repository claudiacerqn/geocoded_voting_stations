Geocodes voting stations in Brazil

You will need a google API key. Go to Google Cloud Services to get one.

The list of all voting stations come from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B85iHUpDSZB5elVFd2R1XzAzX1U/view

I cannot give credit to the person who has published the voting stations' file that was first provided for that person by the Electoral Authority because I cannot remember where I got it. If you know or are that person, please let me know and I will give you full credit. I apologize for not taking note.

I have that same file converted to csv here: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/46847p8avw90txr/locais_voto_2016.csv?dl=0

If you don't want to run the code yourself, email me and I will send you the file with geocoded voting stations (lucasnovaes09 at gmail). If you can, please provide some context where you are going to use the file.
